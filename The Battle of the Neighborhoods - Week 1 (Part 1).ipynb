    "In 2019, there were 27,043 restaurants in the city, up from 24,865 in 2017. New York City's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. \n",
    "\n",
    "Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants from those regions, brought bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes, and delicatessens (or delis) to the city. Italian immigrants brought New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine into the city, while Jewish immigrants and Irish immigrants brought pastrami and corned beef, respectively. Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses are ubiquitous throughout the city. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this gives an idea that New York City hosts different communities along with their choice of food offering restaurants. Also, to supply groceries to all these restaurants, it needs to be studied carefully so one can maximizes it's services to variety of the restaurants in less efforts.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. If you are immigrant looking for a place to live in New York City, which part of the ciy will be better for you as per your native local cuisine taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you are a groceries supplier, then which part of the city will be better in terms of providing services as well in earning highers profits."
